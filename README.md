# hello-world
I should have made an acc here a long time ago :/


So.. first of all I'm a Christian. This is the focus of my life.
Secondly, I'm obsessed with the Warhammer 30K/40K universe.
I don't do table top tho. Not that I dont want to...
I just don't have any friends that are into it.
Used to play video games but I haven't done that much in around 2 years.
I really need to log into my steam account.
Noita, CSGO, and Star Citizen were what I mostly played
Typing that made me miss CS.
I really enjoy reading and writing my own fiction (nothing is posted).

Web Development helps me buy more Top Ramen for my hungry tummy.
